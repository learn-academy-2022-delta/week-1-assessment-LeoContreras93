# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: true or false statements using if, else and else if
  Researched answer: Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.





1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is version control used on your local machine to send or receive information from the cloud(github). github is a website which contains repositiories where one can store their code for everyone to see.

  Researched answer: Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Equality Operators, there are three types, loose equality, strict equality and logical operator

  Researched answer: Boolean values are very useful when making evaluations about data. Equality operators compare one value to the other and judge if the values equate to the same thing. If they do equate to the same a Boolean value of true is returned if not we get a Boolean value of false. There are two types of equality operators, the loose equality operator and the strict equality operator. The loose equality operator converts the two items to the same data type before making a comparison and the strict equality operator requires the two items being compared must be the same data type to return true.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: index is like the number placement order of things, value is a result of something thats being declared.

  Researched answer: The index property is a read-only property. It contains the position of a regular expression match within a string.





4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: something that repeats?

  Researched answer: In JavaScript an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return value upon its termination.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: one is a driver who writes code and the other is a researcher,proof reader 

  Researched answer: higher quality code and faster delivery of it, knowledge sharing, helps build relationships, team morale, helps minimize distractions, brainstorming, allows you to switch roles.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: a function that can be assinged to a variable same way arrays or strings are assigned to variables and returns another function when called upon.

2. Jest: its a open source testing framework and works with React.

3. Objects: like storage containrers that hold data

4. Method: it stores property and can be used in a function?

5. Classes: they are used with objects, they can also be customized like functions and are reusable.
