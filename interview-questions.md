# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: true or false statements using if, else and else if. they create a desired output if certain criteria is met. they change the behavior of data.
  Researched answer: they are decision makers, create a preferred outcome, they help solve problems with multiple inputs and can be useful in structuring an outcome.


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is version control used on your local machine to send or receive information from the cloud(github). github is a website which contains repositiories where one can store their code for everyone to see.

  Researched answer: github is open source and can be used to create repositories and store code as well as have code or files uploaded and be made available to others. git is a version control software available on your own pc, you are able to clone or create repositories(folders). it also helps you keep track of anyc changes you made and manage code.


2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Equality Operators return a boolean value of true or false, there are three types, loose equality which is == and checks only the value(not the prefferred method), strict equality checks both data type and value are equal to each other and relational operator <(less than) or >(greater than)return an outcome of true or false from comparing two things. logical operators &&(and), ||(or), !(not) are use to determine the logic between variables or values.
  Researched answer: the js operators that will return a boolean value are logical operators, equality operators or comparison operators also return a boolean value which is true or false. these operators can also be used in conditional statements. you can have two true statements but javascript will only run the first one.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: index is like the number placement order within an array, value can be assinged to a variable that is being declared using the assignment operator = 
  Researched answer: index is the position of a value assinged on to an array for example. all arrays are indexed no matter the data type. computers use zero based indexing to count starting from 0-10 and so on. it is good practice to declare all variables at the beginning of your code and then assign values to them using the assignmet operator which does not evaluate equality.


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: the repition of a process until a certain condition is met which will determine the output. iteration is used in for loops which are great for counting.

  Researched answer: the process of repeating something over and over again, requires you to initialize a variable then add a condition which will be evaluated before each iteration and you can increment or decrement.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: your driver is typing and listening extremely hands on. Navigator gives directions, is observing for any potential mistakes and has clear path to what is coming next. 

  Researched answer: code quality, focus, accountability, brainstorming ideas, knowledge-sharing, good morale, less mental fatigue.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: a function that can be assinged to a variable same way arrays or strings are assigned to variables and returns another function when called upon. a function within a function.

2. Jest: its a open source testing framework and works with programs like React. Test driven devolopement, allows you to test your code using the describe built-in-method. will check for any errors in your code prior to writing it in its entirety.

3. Objects: like storage containrers that hold data, you can have data types nested in objects and are called upon using dot notation

4. Method: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects using a function which use built in methods like this.

5. Classes:A JavaScript class is not an object. It is a template for JavaScript objects, class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.
