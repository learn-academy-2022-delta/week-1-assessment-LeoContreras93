// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: 5
// b) Verify and explain:  push adds an item to the end of an array


// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 10
// b) Verify and explain: the length built in method is used to count all charachters in a string


// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: o
// b) Verify and explain: in the console bracket notation is being used with the index number 4 which finds the letter at the index of the string


// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby
// b) Verify and explain: in the console log index is being invoked and const index was declared with a value of 1. using zero based indexing the the count starts with = javascript and 1 = ruby and so on.


// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: my expectation was that it would return all letters capatizile. 
// b) Verify and explain: an error occur with the built in method stating it is not a function, the other reason i think it wont work also is the strings are built into an array?? 


// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: my expectation was that there would be an error due to typeof not being declared
// b) Verify and explain: after further research i disovered typeof is an operator that can be used to find the data type of a JavaScript variable.
